\chapter{Introduction}

\begin{remark}{Outline}
\todo{outline}
In this chapter, we present the well-known family of \textit{random forests}
methods. In Section~\ref{sec:4:bias-variance}, we first describe the bias-variance
decomposition of the prediction error and then present, in
Section~\ref{sec:4:ensemble}, how aggregating randomized models through
ensembles reduces the prediction error by decreasing the variance term in this
decomposition. In Section~\ref{sec:4:random-forests}, we revisit random forests
and its variants and study how randomness introduced into the decision trees
reduces prediction errors by decorrelating the decision
trees in the ensemble. Properties and features of random forests are then outlined
in Section~\ref{sec:4:features} while their consistency
is finally explored in Section~\ref{sec:4:consistency}.
