\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

First and foremost, I would like to sincerely thank my advisor Prof. Dr. Bj\"orn Ottersten for the 
continuous support during my Ph.D study and research, for his motivation, enthusiasm, and for the 
freedom I was granted throughout these years.

My sincere thanks also goes to my co-advisor Dr. Djamila Aouada for her support, guidance, and 
encouragement not only from the research point of view, but for life in general. 

Deepest gratitude are also due to all members of the jury for their interest in this work and for 
taking the  time to evaluate this dissertation.

Special thanks go to the fraud management team at CETREL a SIX Company. In particular to Guy Weber 
and Philippe Davin, for all the time they invest in helping me understand all the 
particularities of the credit card fraud detection problem. Moreover, for their insights 
during the different steps of my research.

I would also like to convey thanks for supporting this Ph.D project to the AFR Grant Scheme (Aides 
la Formation-Recherche), managed by the National Research Fund of Luxembourg (FNR).

I cannot finish without saying how grateful I am with my wife Alejandra and son Pablo. They have 
always supported and encouraged me to do my best in all matters of life.
